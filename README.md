# SecurityAuditScript
My security audit script that decreases time wasted on obtaining audit information and returns it into a textfile. It then opens the text file ready to be analysed.
It was written and compiled in Python 3.10.5. 

Some features require admin priviledges

Some features added as a bonus that dont need to be there

Remember to change the names of AV and VPN

You can use Nuitka to convert this into a portable .exe. I have this saved on my USB stick, ready for auditing. Remember to make a copy of the output for multiple
devices, as the output.txt file will be overwritten everytime.

Heres a guide I used to convert https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdZd7LolWm0
